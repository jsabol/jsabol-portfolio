The Office of Financial Research was established in 2010 as a response to the 07-08 financial crisis. As a relatively new government agency, OFR's online presence was a subsite of the Department of Treasury's website. However, as a watchdog organization, it was important that they show their independence. The organization sought a website that would establish OFR's online presence and brand, distinguish OFR as a separate entity from the Department of Treasury, and communicate and make transparent the top risks to financial stability. 

My role on the team was Lead Designer, which involved working onsite with the client and coordinating with an offsite design team, which consisted of graduates from [the UX Design course I had taught](/project/ux-practice).

## User Research

We conducted an online survey in order to better understand potential OFR website visitors. We wanted to capture as many potential visitors as possible and guessed that most respondents would not have much experience or interest in financial research. So, we expanded the scope of the questions to “financial or economic research” since the stability of financial markets is closely related to the economy as a whole. The survey was randomly distributed utilizing surveymonkey.com.

## Architectural Stream

I facilitated 7 card sorting sessions with individuals or small groups. Participants sorted site features into groups and then labeled those groups.

This diagram shows the analysis of all 7 card sorts together. Items close together in the tree were sorted together frequently. Items far apart in the tree were not closely related.

## Thematic Stream

I met with key project stakeholders for an ideation session to discuss the vision of the website.

Based on the market research, we developed User Personas to describe the target audience. Using the personas, we wrote adjectives which represented their archetypes and created a mood board from those adjectives. From the mood boards, I created style tiles.

## Result

I started with black & white responsive wireframes, then a high fidelity design, and then a coded prototype. Some of my recommended design features were...

* Embedding PDF research papers into the site so visitors would not need to download a PDF to read them.
* Magazine-style homepage: An engaging roll-up of the latest site updates.
* Related content: Cross-linking to pages which relate to the current page to keep visitors browsing and engaged.
* Providing a short author bio at the end of content to encourage trust and credibility.
