" The Postal Service will soon launch Stamp Fulfillment Services (SFS) Web, an online application that will make it easier for Postmasters and customer service and retail managers to submit and manage stamp orders. The new service will offer a more convenient, user-friendly order entry and stamp-inventory management process." -  [Stamp ordering, simplified](http://postalemployeenetwork.com/news/2014/06/usps-stamp-ordering-simplified/)

My role on the project was UX Developer.
