## Readers want great stories

Fanfiction is original stories that use the setting, characters, or situations from a TV show, book, movie, or any other work.

I conducted [a survey](https://shesjulie.typeform.com/to/iPH5Ba) which included 69 fanfiction readers. Survey takers were asked about what happens, before, during, and after they read fanfiction.

The survey produced four major discoveries: 

1. Over half of potential users are on mobile devices.
2. Many users are reading in the evening or in bed. 
3. Writing quality is a major pain point.
4. The vast majority of people are using sorting and filtering features to find fanfiction.

I also analyzed all 69 responses to key questions in a spreadsheet analysis, to get a thorough understanding of the issues users had with the apps and sites they were currently using. The top issues were **sorting and filtering** problems, **quality of writing, not enough content,** and **saving preferences** between visits.

## Usability testing


I tested my prototype with 3 participants, 1 of which whom were already familiar with the project.

Top Findings:

- **3 out of 3** people didn’t understand the number counts beneath the “not interested” and “bookmark” buttons. 
- **2 out of 3** people got lost after using the filter buttons within the story itself, being unable to find a back or menu button.
- **2 out of 3** people thought the filter buttons on the story page would start a new search, rather than add the filter to the current search.
